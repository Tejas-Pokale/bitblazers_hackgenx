Project Overview:

RecycLens – See Waste Differently

RecycLens is a smart and sustainable e-waste management solution designed to revolutionize how we identify, categorize, and dispose of electronic waste. Built with cutting-edge AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology, RecycLens empowers users to simply scan old electronic devices using their smartphone camera, instantly receive intelligent classification, and take action—either recycle, resell or dispose them.
The platform includes an AI-powered classification system, a marketplace for selling functioning devices, and a dedicated portal for recycling centers to manage pick-ups, track rewards, and maintain user records. By bridging the gap between users and recycling centers, RecycLens aims to reduce electronic waste and encourage responsible disposal practices.
